Two critical bugs with 0.1.0 so I have made a quick patch release to fix the issue.

Specifically the bugs are:

 * [Input.byteArray iterates through stream twice](https://github.com/jesseeichar/scala-io/issues/closed#issue/3)
 * [Resource.fromFileString("...").byteArray goes into an infinite loop](https://github.com/jesseeichar/scala-io/issues/closed#issue/5)

Both are now fixed with the 0.1.1 release.

In addition the following issue was addressed:

 * [Add more asFoo converters for converting objects to Input/Output/etc... objects](https://github.com/jesseeichar/scala-io/issues/closed#issue/2)

The files are on scala-tools.org.  To get running with Scala IO take a look at http://jesseeichar.github.com/scala-io/getting-started.html

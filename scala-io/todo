Streamable (need details on how patching works)
LongTraversable
ResourceTraversable
SeqLongTraversable

== Misc
Make LineTraversable a LongTraversable
Test that Traversables in Input are lazy
Make SeqLongTraversable more performant with drop etc...
Try to make LongTraversable implementations views


== Considerations
Add protected aliasing/imports to java classes in package to reduce number or required imports
Consider adding Path implicits to a package object

How to implement a new filesystem (do while creating zip FS)

== Tests
moveTo between 2 different file systems
setting current directory (Supported by RAM and ZIP)
test root of root == root

== Misc
Should I merge access and FileAttributes into one?
Remove casts with typeclasses and generics
Path.AccessModes should be put top level
Add openOptions: Seq[OpenOption] to FileOps.withLock
Path.Matcher tests
Path.Matcher should be in PathMatcher and extent PathMatcher
Path.notExists => Path.nonExistant
Make ReadChars use LongTraversable
Make LineTraversable a LongTraversable
Remove parameter defaults from overridden methods 
Make ResourceTraversableView's append,filter,flatmap efficient when a drop is performed after the operation
Make Codec immutable
test copy and move between filesystems
DirectoryStream to throw exceptions (NotDirectoryException perhaps)
FileOps to throw exceptions if not file (NotFileException perhaps)
use useful exceptions 1.  See java7 exceptions (can mix them in) 2.  search for all intercept[IOException] and see if there is a better way
Add default ExceptionHandlers and allow them to be set on a FileOps
deleteRecursively should not return tuple.  It should be a case class
Implement an mutable seekable that always reuses the same fileChannel
Make DefaultFileSystem.open not close the resource
Make a ChannelBased LongTraversable
Lock should provide a seekable that is restricted to lock area

== Considerations
Add protected aliasing/imports to java classes in package to reduce number or required imports
Consider adding Path implicits to a package object
Should BufferSize be a global variable? (I think probably settable.  Maybe like a logger so different situations/objects can have different sizes)
How should singly traversable streams be handled
Decide if I want to add to java.protocol.handler.packages:
      val PKGS_KEY = "java.protocol.handler.pkgs"
    
      def initProtocolHandler = {
        val pkg = getClass.getPackage.getName
  
        val prop = Option(System getProperty PKGS_KEY).map {_ split "\\|"}.orElse(Some(Array[String]()))
        prop foreach { p => 
          val newProp = (p :+ pkg ).distinct mkString "|"
          System.setProperty(PKGS_KEY, newProp)
        }
      }


== Plugin
Use Java 7 fileSystem plugin architecture

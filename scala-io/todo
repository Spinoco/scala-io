Streamable (need details on how patching works)
LongTraversable
ResourceTraversable
SeqLongTraversable
Path

== Misc
Make ReadChars use LongTraversable
Make LineTraversable a LongTraversable
Remove parameter defaults from overridden methods 
Make ResourceTraversableView's append,filter,flatmap efficient when a drop is performed after the operation
Make Codec immutable

== Considerations
Add protected aliasing/imports to java classes in package to reduce number or required imports
Consider adding Path implicits to a package object
Should BufferSize be a global variable? (I think probably settable.  Maybe like a logger so different situations/objects can have different sizes)
How should singly traversable streams be handled

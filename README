The goal of this project is to create an Input/Output and filesystem access API for scala.  The main inspiration is the Java 7 NIO file API combined with the scala-arm project being worked on by jseureth.

The implementation will work with Java 6+ and will depend on scala-arm but not on the Java 7 NIO file API.

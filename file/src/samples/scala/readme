*************************************************************************************
 This file contains code samples illustrating how to use the Scala IO API.  It is
 not a test file, other than it is compiled.


 These examples will be the bases for the tests created for the IO project

 Note: In order to be more useful all variable have the expected type explicitly
       declared so that the compiler can detect if there is a problem with the
       sample code.  It is not required to work

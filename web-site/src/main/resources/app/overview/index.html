  The Scala IO umbrella project consists of a few sub projects for different aspects and
  extensions of IO.  The core project deals with raw input and output, primarily through
  streams and channels (at least the Java implementation).
  </p>
  <p>
  Warning #1: The current API is a very early version and is likely to change.
  That said barring a massive outcry the core components should remain fairly consistent. Both the core and file projects will be changing but file is even more likely to change.
  Especially with regard to FileAttributes and the API for implementing custom filesystems.
  </p><p>
  Warning #2: I have spent no time on optimization so there are a large number of
  known inefficiencies.  Patches and suggestions are welcome but please keep flaming to a minimum.

  As an example of what Scala IO brings to the table the following examples compare Java IO vs Scala IO performing
  a simple task of reading data from two URLs and writing them to a file. (I found it amusing that I actually messed up
  the Java example the first try and had to debug it).

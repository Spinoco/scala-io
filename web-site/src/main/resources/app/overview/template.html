  The Scala IO umbrella project consists of a few sub projects for different aspects and
  extensions of IO.  The core project deals with raw input and output, primarily through
  streams and channels (at least the Java implementation).

  <em>Warning:</em> I have spent no time on optimization so there are a large number of
  known inefficiencies.  I have started to write a suite of performance tests to track and measure the performance and the performance should begin to improve from this point forward.

  As an example of what Scala IO brings to the table the following examples compare Java IO vs Scala IO performing
  a simple task of reading data from two URLs and writing them to a file. (I found it amusing that I actually messed up
  the Java example the first try and had to debug it).

Hi,

Following the emails about Path-File-Directory with great interest.  But it seems to me that there is a misunderstanding about the relationship between Path-File-Directory.  I have an email written up about that.  But first I want to let everyone know about the code samples files I am starting to illustrate how the API is to be used.  It will form the basis of the test-cases.  

The point of this file is to make sure that we have a useable API for common tasks.  I have not had time to inspect the ARM project yet so tips would be appreciated so I can bring my examples more inline with the ARM project.

I am NOT convinced the File-Directory-Path split is a good idea so I have two sets of samples. 

Samples with File-Directory-Path

Samples with only a Path class
http://github.com/jesseeichar/ScalaIO/blob/master/src/test/scala/io/samples_path_only

I will be adding more and more examples.
